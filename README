This repo contains a simple Android app that builds upon the Spring MVC application in the RegistrationDemo repo.  Like the Spring application, the Android app is for demonstration purposes only.

I've included the project metadata (all of the .* directories and files) from the Android Development Toolkit. 

I've also attached a software license in case anyone finds something they want to reuse.  The license is there for the warranty/liability clause more than anything else; I'm not particularly concerned about someone stealing the intellectual property.
